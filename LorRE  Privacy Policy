LorRE 
Privacy Policy
Effective Date: 10 Jan 2024
Introduction
LorRE helps you find the perfect apartment for rent by filtering real estate posts from Facebook groups. We take your privacy seriously and are committed to protecting your information. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your choices regarding your data.
Information We Collect
Facebook Data: With your permission, we collect public data from Facebook groups you select, including post content, images, locations, and basic information about the group itself. We do not collect any private information from your Facebook profile.
User Information: We collect your Facebook name, profile picture, age range, hometown, and current city and country, as entered by the user in their profile, 
Website Usage Data: We collect information about your interactions with our website, such as the pages you visit and the links you click.
How We Use Your Information
Filter and personalize real estate listings: We use the Facebook data and your location preferences to filter and prioritize listings that are relevant to your needs.
Targeted advertising: We share your basic user information with third-party advertising services who use it to show you relevant ads based on your age range and city. You can opt out of targeted advertising at any time (see Your Choices below).
Website improvement: We use website usage data to improve the functionality and user experience of our website.
Your Choices
Facebook Permissions: You can control what data we collect from your Facebook profile through Facebook's privacy settings.
Targeted Advertising: You can opt out of targeted advertising by opting out of Targeted Ads. We understand you may prefer seeing ads that are less specific to your personal details. No worries! You can easily opt out of targeted advertising within our app: 
Head to Settings: Click on the gear icon in the top right corner of your app screen.
Navigate to Privacy: Under the "General" tab, tap on "Privacy Settings‚Äù
Toggle Away Targeted Ads: Find the "Targeted Ads" option and slide the switch to "Off." Boom, done!
After opting out, you'll still see ads within the app. However, these ads will no longer be based on your Facebook information like age range, hometown, or browsing habits. Think of them as friendly neighborhood billboards, offering general deals and services instead of personalized recommendations.
For example, instead of seeing an ad for apartments in your preferred neighborhood, you might see a broader ad for a moving company or furniture store. It's still relevant to your apartment hunting journey, but without the targeted precision. Remember, choosing "Off" simply means we won't use your Facebook data for ad targeting. We only ever share your name, age range, city, and country for basic demographic calculations that advertisers use to reach a wider audience. No private information, no hidden trackers, just ads that blend in with the scenery.

Data access and deletion: You can request access to or deletion of your personal information by contacting us at user_request@lorre.ai. We value your privacy and take these requests seriously. While accessing your data is as simple as contacting us, data deletion involves a few verification steps to ensure it's the right decision and processed accurately. We'll guide you through the process every step of the way, and rest assured, every request is ultimately fulfilled diligently
Data Security
We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. We store your data in a secure database and encrypt sensitive information such as Facebook IDs. However, please note that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. 
Changes to This Policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on our website.
