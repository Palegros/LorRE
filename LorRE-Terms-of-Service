Terms of Service
Effective Date: 10 Jan 2024
Welcome to LorRE!
By using our awesome app, you agree to these Terms of Service (the "Terms" if you're fancy). We respect all our users and their love for digital goodies, so we kindly ask you to take a moment and familiarize yourself with these Terms. They basically keep things smooth and ensure everyone has a happy home-finding experience. But hey, if something doesn't sit right, you're always free to choose another path. Now, let's explore LorRE's magic together

Use of the Service
Eligibility 
Everyone's welcome in the awesome world of LorRE. Just a couple of things to keep things smooth:

User Account
To access certain features of the Service, you may be required to create a user account. Searching for a home shouldn't feel like climbing Mount Everest. Creating a user account is like leveling up your game, granting you access to powerful tools and perks. Save searches, get instant alerts for new listings, and even chat directly with landlords. It's your VIP pass to a smoother, faster, and more successful home-hunting journey.
Content and User Conduct
User-Generated Content 
You're in charge of what you share on LorRE (think of it as your home-hunting megaphone). You are solely responsible for the content you post on the Service. When you tell us your preferences (like the ‘must-haves’ for your dream pad), you give us a peek into your vision. This helps us suggest amazing matches, but don't worry, your secrets are safe. By posting content (such as your personal priorities for your home-hunting journey), you grant LorRE a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to use, modify, and reproduce the content. We'll use your input anonymously, never sharing your priorities publicly or linking them to your profile. It's all about tailoring your journey, not broadcasting your details.
Prohibited Conduct
You agree not to engage in any activity that may interfere with or disrupt the Service or violate any laws.
Be a good neighbor: This means playing fair and using LorRE for its intended purpose. For example, don't try to hack into the app or create fake accounts to manipulate search results. Let's keep things fun and ethical for everyone
No spam zone: While sharing your excitement is great, please avoid posting irrelevant or repetitive content that might disrupt others' experience. Think of it like keeping your apartment clean and clutter-free, making LorRE a pleasant space for everyone to explore.
Respect the rules: Just like following traffic laws keeps the roads safe, respecting LorRE's guidelines ensures a smooth and enjoyable experience for all. For example, avoid posting offensive content or harassing other users. Remember, kindness is key!
Intellectual Property
Ownership
LorRE retains all rights, title, and interest in and to the Service, including all intellectual property rights. LorRE is like a treasure map leading to amazing homes, and we hold the key. All the clever algorithms, unique features, and innovative tech behind the scenes belong to us (the mapmakers). You can enjoy it, you are the explorer, free to follow the map, discover hidden gems, and even leave your own mark on your journey.
License
LorRE grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Service for personal, non-commercial purposes. Think of LorRE as a VIP club for home-hunters. We roll out the red carpet and give you a special pass to use all the awesome features. It's like a personal guide at your fingertips, helping you find your dream place. This pass is just for you (non-transferable) and for your home-hunting adventures (personal, non-commercial purposes). And hey, we reserve the right to adjust things in the future if needed, but we'll always keep things cool and user-friendly.
Privacy
Data Collection 
LorRE may collect and use certain information and this is exactly why transparency matters. We care about what data we collect and how we use it. To keep things crystal clear, we've outlined everything in our Privacy Policy. It's a quick read, and it explains how we help you find your dream home while respecting your privacy. 
Cookies
By using LorRE, you agree to cookies to be collected which helps us keep your home-hunting adventure smooth and personalized. Think of cookies as sticky notes for your dream digs, remembering your preferences like sunny balconies and spacious kitchens to show you more of what makes your heart sing.

Termination
At LorRE we  create and maintain a safe space. LorRE reserves the right to terminate or suspend your account and access to the Service at its sole discretion. LorRE is dedicated to a positive and respectful experience for everyone. While rare, we reserve the right to terminate accounts that violate our guidelines, like posting offensive content or misusing features. Imagine, just like in a cozy library, LorRE wants to ensure everyone enjoys finding their perfect book (home) without disruptions.
Limitation of Liability
LorRE strives to make your home-hunting journey smooth and exciting. But just like navigating any adventure, sometimes unexpected things can happen. While we're always here to help, this means LorRE doesn't take responsibility for certain types of loss, like:
"Indirect" - Think of it like a detour: Imagine you miss a job interview because LorRE's website has a temporary glitch. While annoying, this wouldn't directly affect your ability to find a home, so LorRE wouldn't be responsible for the missed opportunity.
"Incidental" - Like extra fees: If using LorRE leads to minor expenses, like needing to print extra documents, these unexpected costs wouldn't fall on LorRE's shoulders.
"Special" - Unique situations: Let's say you have a specific property requirement related to a rare allergy, and despite LorRE's best efforts, no suitable options emerge. Unfortunately, due to the unique nature of the situation, LorRE wouldn't be responsible for not finding the perfect match.
"Consequential" - Future ripples: If unforeseen circumstances related to using LorRE (like a delay in your search) lead to future losses (like missing a moving deadline), these wouldn't be under LorRE's liability.
"Punitive"- Zero tolerance for bad apples. LorRE believes in a positive and respectful home-hunting experience for all. This means we have a zero-tolerance policy for any intentional wrongdoing or harmful behavior on our platform. While this section might seem technical, it simply ensures that LorRE isn't held responsible for the actions of others who choose to misuse the platform maliciously. We work hard to maintain a safe and secure environment, but remember, being a responsible user is key to keeping things positive for everyone.
Governing Law
These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Israel, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
Changes to Terms
LorRE reserves the right to update or modify these Terms at any time. Your continued use of the Service after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.
