LorRE
User-Data Deletion Request
Effective Date: 10 Jan 2024
Introduction
To initiate a data deletion, users must submit a support ticket directly to the email user_request@lorre.ai, clearly articulating their intentions regarding the data deletion. Subsequently, the application will respond to the user with a follow-up question to ensure verification and perform necessary validations to secure the process.

Instructions 
Users can delete their accounts from the app. This action results in the removal of all associated elements, such as preferences, user feedback, and personal activity within the app, encompassing the user's history. Each user is permitted to request deletion exclusively for their own account; bulk deletion via support tickets is not permissible at this stage.

Identity confirmation will be undertaken by the support team within 30 days of receiving the request, extending up to 90 days after the user affirms the deletion. At every stage of the process, an email confirmation is dispatched. The deletion process comprises five steps, initiated by the user:

the user requests data deletion via email.
Human approval is granted for the request, and user identity is validated.
The user is prompted to furnish additional information concerning the data deletion, including pertinent highlights.
Confirmation of identity.
Final stage - deletion, and approval via email.
